# Chapter 1: History of K8s

 - Introduced in 2014 and donated to the Cloud Native Computing Foundation
 - K8s abstracts underlying infrastructure

# Chapter 1: Kubernetes & Docker
Docker has tools that build and paclage applications as container images (and runs containers).

It's common practice to use docker for build-time tasks, then use K8s and docker to run them.

K8s container Runtime Interface (CRI) - standardizes the way container runtimes (like Docker) work with  k8s

Runtime classes - gVisor or Kata Containers runtimes might be better suited for workload isolation.

containerd (*container dee*) - Stripped down docker after K8s 1.20
